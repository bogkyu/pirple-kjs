# Homework Assignment #2: Variables and Constants

What are the differences between `let`, `const` and `var`? When would each be appropriate to use? In your own words, write 1 - 2 paragraphs explaining the different use-cases for each. If English is not your native language, feel free to write in whatever language you prefer. Just please note which language it is at the top of the assignment, so we know how to translate it.

Create a file called `variables.js` and add your explanation as comments at the top of the page.

Then, within the document write 3 code examples (1 for `var`, 1 for `const` and 1 for `let`) showcasing the use-cases you explained above.

## Extra Credit:

To earn extra credit, add an explanation of "_hoisting_" to the top of your document. What is hoisting? What does the word mean, and how does hoisting work in Javascript?
