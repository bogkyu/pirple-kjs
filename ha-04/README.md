# Homework Assignment #4: Functions
 
Let's go back to your syllogism (logical argument) examples from Homework #3.  Now it's time to turn those loose bits of logic into functions. Rather than having procedure that demonstrates that Socrates is mortal, you should create a function that accepts a name and returns a boolean (True or False) representing whether that name identifies a man who is mortal or not. Your function to gracefully handle unexpected inputs (such as an unrecognized name or a name that is a not a string at all) without throwing an exception.

## Extra Credit:

If you did the extra credit on Homework #3, let's turn that example into a function as well. It should accept in 2 arguments:

1. An array of all cake possibilities (vanilla or chocolate)
2. A boolean representing whether or not the cake is chocolate.

It should return a string indicating the actual flavor of the cake.
