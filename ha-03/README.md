# Homework Assignment #3: Statements and Operators

Let's look at a popular logical argument (a syllogism).

> All men are mortal
> Socrates is a man.
> Therefore, socrates is mortal.

Using "if statements" and any other logical operators and data-types you see fit, recreate this logical argument. Your code should make clear that "_Socrates_" is part of a collection of items referred to as "_men_", and that all members of this collection are mortal. You should also then demonstrate that since Socrates is part of this collection, it follows that he is mortal as well.

## Extra Credit:

Got the hang of creating a logical argument? Want to try another one? Try this one as well:

> This cake is either vanilla or chocolate.
> This cake is not chocolate.
> Therefore, this cake is vanilla.

## Note:
Here I have two files, `syllogism-simple.js` which is basically the homework, and `syllogisms-advanced.js` which contains a more rigurous attempt to solve the generic sylogism.  Incomplete tested.
